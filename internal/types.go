// Core is the internal representation of a parsed JWT: its decoded header,
// claims, and signature, plus cached parse state consumed by the verification
// fast path. Cores are pooled — obtain one from a Parse* function and return it
// with ReleaseCore.

	Signature string

	Raw       string

	// can read it without storing the string as an interface in Header (which
	// causes one heap allocation per parse for the string→any boxing).
	// Empty when the slow path (full header decode) was used.
